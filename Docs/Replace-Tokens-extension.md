In Azure DevOps pipelines, the **"Replace Tokens"** task is used to **replace placeholders** (tokens) in configuration files or other text files with actual values during the pipeline execution. This is particularly useful for managing environment-specific settings or sensitive information without hardcoding them in your source code.

### Key Uses:
1. **Configuration File Updates**:
   - Replaces tokens in files like `appsettings.json`, `web.config`, or `YAML` files with values defined in ***`pipeline variables`*** or ***`variable groups`***.
   - Example: A token `#{DatabaseConnectionString}#` in a config file can be replaced with the actual connection string stored in a pipeline variable.

2. **Environment-Specific Customization**:
   - Allows you to use the same configuration file across multiple environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod) by swapping out token values based on the pipeline's context.

3. **Secret Management**:
   - Keeps sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) out of source control by storing them in Azure DevOps variables or Key Vault and injecting them at runtime.

4. **Dynamic Value Injection**:
   - Enables dynamic updates to files based on pipeline variables, such as build numbers, release versions, or environment names.

### How It Works:
- **Syntax**: Tokens in files are typically defined with a specific pattern, like `#{VariableName}#` or `${{VariableName}}` (configurable in the task).
- **Task Configuration**: The Replace Tokens task is added to the pipeline YAML or classic editor, where you specify:
  - The target files (e.g., `**/*.config` to process all `.config` files).
  - The token prefix and suffix (default is often `#{` and `}#`).
- **Variable Mapping**: The task looks for pipeline variables (or variable group variables) that match the token names and replaces the tokens with their values.

### Example:
**Input File** (`appsettings.json`):
```json
{
  "ConnectionString": "#{DbConnection}#",
  "ApiKey": "#{ApiKey}#"
}
```

**Pipeline Variables**:
- `DbConnection`: `Server=myServer;Database=myDb;`
- `ApiKey`: `xyz123`

**Pipeline YAML**:
```yaml
- task: ReplaceTokens@5
  inputs:
    targetFiles: '**/appsettings.json'
    tokenPrefix: '#{'
    tokenSuffix: '}#'
```

**Output File** (`appsettings.json` after task):
```json
{
  "ConnectionString": "Server=myServer;Database=myDb;",
  "ApiKey": "xyz123"
}
```

### Common Scenarios:
- Replacing database connection strings in configuration files for different environments.
- Injecting version numbers or build IDs into application settings.
- Updating API endpoints or credentials based on the deployment target.

### Benefits:
- Simplifies configuration management.
- Enhances security by avoiding hardcoding sensitive data.
- Promotes reusability of configuration files across environments.
